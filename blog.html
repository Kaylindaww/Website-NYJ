            <p>
              I feel like Trevor Noah's mother was looking for that sense of belonging to the extend<br>
              that she forgot her values ,remember she could not stay with Trevor's father because of<br>
              apartheid policy that did not allow the black to marry the whites but still I will blame<br>
              her for not checking into his character before marriage,even Noah himself told her not to<br>
              marry him because something was not right about him but she still persisted and went ahead<br>
              with the marriage so I feel like the entire problem solely is  hers because actually she had the<br>
              choice to leave at a early stage when he had just started showing his negative sides,that<br>
              also happens alot among young women today where they tend to stay in abusive marriage just<br>
              in the name of love and children or maybe they fear  what the society will think about<br>
              them which to it's very wrong because we all have to set standards and limits for ourselves<br>
              if we want to live free and independent lives.

        <h3>How humur helped Noah to make friends and out of dark times.</h3>

        <p id="contents1">
            Noah being a colored  kid had alot of challenages making friends because<br>
            all the students were racially segregated and he really did not have<br>
            any friends but his humur helped him to stay everywhere with any group<br>
            because he could tell jokes in all the groups,know alittle about it <br>
            and leaves so actually he never had any real friend in school but he <br>
            was welcomed everywhere though he never stayed his welcome.<br>
            “I wasn't popular, but I wasn't an outcast. I was everywhere with everybody,<br> 
            and at the same time I was all by myself.”said Noah.<br>
            This made him never felt so lonely at school.He also made alot of <br>
            friends among girls because he knew how to make them laugh.<br>
            Being the fastest boy in school also helped him to earn alot<br>
            of money from his friend by being the fastest to reach the canteen so<br>
            he could buy for the rich kids who can't run and he was paid for it,<br>
            these also helped him to not only get transport money and savings but<br>
            made him even more close to the different groups in school .I would<br>
            that is the start of his career where because his humur he got to know<br>
            the different groups and ended up being given the cd writer by Daniel which<br>
            was the opening of his career by being his middleman.<br>
            This is seen in this quote<br>
            "I could jump in the circle and dance with the township kids. <br>
